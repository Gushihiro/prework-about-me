      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello I'm Hiroto. I've been living in Seattle for a little over 2 years working 
        at a Green Tea Shop. I'm hoping to complete this bootcamp and start a career in 
        web/software development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Before living in Seattle, I resided in North Carolina for about 12 years. Prior to that,
        I lived in Japan.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy gaming, watching movies, drawing, reading, and making food.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Although I don't have a particular dream job, I'd like to work a job that allows me to work
        from a variety of different places around the world without interfering with work output.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Seattle.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe the skills required to be a web developer are very versatile and offer a 
        solid basis of understanding, as well as many opportunities within programming fields.
